              <p> Last semester I took a children's literature class. We read about four different versions of the same story, noting the similarities and differences.This was easy. But what I never considered was how the original storytellers might have felt seeing their stories told over and over again, and seeing them constantly change. Lessig talks a lot about the benefits of a free culture, of the importance of ripping, mixing, and burning. The concept of rip, mix, and burn, is what keeps people creative and keeps content flowing. People draw inspiration from the things around them and from the people around them. If we weren't able to draw from the things around us, we wouldn't have anything left to create. But I also understand that there are logistics to be considered. We cannot just blatantly steal another creator's work. If we did, it would be copyright infringement. But I think true creators appreciate art, and they appreciate its growth. For example, TV show and movie creators never get upset when fans create fan fiction, because they appreciate that their art had enough impact to inspire others to carry on their work. As long as people uphold and respect the message that an artist is trying to get across, then ripping, mixing, and burning creativity benefits everyone involved.</p>
